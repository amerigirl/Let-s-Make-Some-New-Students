# Lets-Make-Some-New-Students

# Description
This app will give you an opportunity to view, create, update and delete students in a mock database.  It will also allow you, once created, to upload an image that shows your student, along with the ability to change your image and basic demographic data at any time. This app uses the Angular framework with Angular Materials for styling.  

This is a basic CRUD app designed to give you practice with the foundational elements of working with Angular and connecting to an API to provide access to a database for persistent storage. 

# Getting Started

To get started:
1. Download the repo
2. Open using VSCode (or any Angular supported code-editor of your choice)
3. run NPM install to install the node modules, and then run ng serve to take a look!


If you would like to add your own persistent storage, you will need go into the services and update the http requests there. Otherwise, feel free to download the companion repo for a ready-made backend storage setup!
